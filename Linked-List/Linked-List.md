# Linked List

## Benefits over Arrays
1. Don't need to pre allocate space (Allocate whatever is needed)
2. Insertion is easier

## Time Complexity
* Insert/Delete Element at the beginning = O(1)
* Insert/Delete Element at the end = O(n)
* Traversal = O(n)
* Accessing element By value = o(n) 

## Double Linked List vs Single Link List
